I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), the University of Adelaide. I obtained my PhD degree at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, The University of Adelaide, under the supervision of [Prof. Javen Shi](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/)ï¼Œ[A/Prof. Lingqiao Liu](https://lingqiao-adelaide.github.io/lingqiaoliu.github.io/), and [Dr Ehsan Abbasnejad](https://ehsanabb.github.io/). My research focuses on developing innovative AI education and quantitative trading solutions by leveraging Causal AI and NLP to uncover insights into complex decision-making processes.
