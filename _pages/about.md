I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/), the University of Adelaide. I obtained my PhD degree at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning, The University of Adelaide, under the supervision of [Prof. Javen Shi](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/). My research delves into devising groundbreaking approaches for agricultural dilemmas and Quant Trading, utilizing Causal AI and NLP to unravel the nuances of decision-making paradigms.
